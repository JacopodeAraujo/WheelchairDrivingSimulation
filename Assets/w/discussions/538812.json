But there is a problem with InputSimulator. \r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I click in a text box on the page and simulate keystroke, browser (System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser) responds to VK_TAB and VK_BACK but not VK_RETURN or any letter or number. I call SetForegroundWindow from user32.dll before, because browser and keyboard are in separate windows, to make browser window active. \r<br />\n<br />\nDo you have an idea of ​​what could be the reason? How to fix this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
