    "Html": "From what I understand of the library, the ModifiedKeyStroke and KeyPress functions work as a &quot;KeyDown&quot; and then &quot;KeyUp&quot;. What you need to do in order to use that shortcut is to <em>hold</em> the Ctrl key down while the vertical stroll happens -- so, switching ModifiedKeyStroke to KeyPress and then using the Mouse scroll function should (theoretically) work.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps. I know this post is like 10 months old, though...<br />\n",
