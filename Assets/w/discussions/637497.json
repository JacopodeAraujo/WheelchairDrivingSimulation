    "Html": "I want to create a program that converts CEC input from a TV into generic keyboard input. At the moment, I'm just trying to get keyboard buttons to be simulated.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo far, this library rocks. It has made a lot of what I want to do so much easier. I've been using it by setting hotkeys that when pressed, simulates a keyboard press.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis works for everything I have tried (space, enter, backspace) and needed except my arrow keys. The hotkey works and the code runs, but my text cursor in Notepad doesn't move.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe code used is just this:<br />\n<pre><code>  InputSimulator kb= new InputSimulator();\n  kb.Keyboard.KeyPress(VirtualKeyCode.LEFT);</code></pre>\n\nSo while I can delete characters, return new lines, add spaces, etc. I can't move the text cursor as you would by pressing the arrow keys. \r<br />\n<br />\nThe arrow keys are necessary for my application to be useful, so if I can't get this to work I'll have to put it on hold.<br />\n",
