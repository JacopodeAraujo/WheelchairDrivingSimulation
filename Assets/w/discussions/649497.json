LCONTROL, LMENU work perfect but LSHIFT isn't working at all. Not sure why. Guessing it is because of the IsExtended property. I was going to try to clone the project on NuGet but I do not see that option.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf anyone can help me get that LSHIFT key working correctly I would greatly appreciate it. And when I say it isn't working, it works as a regular shift key but if you try to use it with shortcuts etc it doesn't work. Shift pluc C for example will create a capital letter, but it won't work with shortcut combinations. <br />\n",

Same code on two different devices, one a Surface Book and the other a Custom PC. The code works with the LSHIFT on the custom PC, but it does not work on the Surface Book. Same OS, Windows 10.<br />\n",
